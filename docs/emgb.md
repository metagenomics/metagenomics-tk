### Exploratory Metagenome Browser (EMGB)

The output generated by the Metagenomics-Toolkit can be imported into [EMGB](https://gitab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/cmg/emgb/emgb-server).
EMGB allows you to easily explore your metagenomic samples in terms of MAGs, genes and their function.

You can either directly specify the export to EMGB in your config file when you analyse your samples or you can afterwards execute the
export by running the toolkit again with the export entrypoint. Please read the [export module](modules/export.md) documentation on how to run the export functionality.
