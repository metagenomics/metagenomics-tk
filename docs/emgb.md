### Exploratory Metagenome Browser (EMGB)

The output generated by the Metagenomics-Toolkit can be imported into [EMGB](https://gitab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/cmg/emgb/emgb-server).
EMGB allows you to easily explore your metagenomic samples in terms of MAGs, genes and their function.

You can either directly specify the export to EMGB in your config file when you analyse your samples, or you can execute the
export afterwards by running the toolkit again with the export entry point. Please read the [export module](modules/export.md) documentation to learn how to use the export functionality.
