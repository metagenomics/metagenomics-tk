Every module of the Metagenomics-Toolkit can be executed independent of any other module.
This section defines the input YAML, input TSV file and the files that are output.
The explanation of how to use the Toolkit and any configuration parameters can be found in the [Getting Started](../overview.md) and the [Configuration](../configuration.md) section.
